# RepMoji

Static websites are awesome! The JAM Stack receives a crazy amount of love, especially here on Github. I'd like to contribute to that. Introducting RepMoji!

## What Now?

RepMoji is a combination of Reply and Emoji.

## How do I use this?

RepMoji can be deployed on Glitch.com, Heroku, or with Docker! From there it's as easy as setting up your emoji reactions and added the `<script>` tag.
